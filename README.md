# Team Contract

# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

We will meet twice a week for one hour each time. We will meet in person so we don't need a software
tool. We will take turns writing notes at each meeting, and use a google doc shared with everyone to
store and share them. 

2. **Assistance** 

We are all close friends, so we will communicate via text message. People will be expected to 
respond the same day. 

3. **Respect** 

We will not talk over each other during meetings, so that everyone can get there ideas across with
ease. We will also be responsible for keeping up to date with the project group chat so that
everyone can do their end effevtively. We will promote sharing thoughts and ideas by giving each
person a turn to speak when needed.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

We will assign work equally for each part of the project, frontend or backend. Our team believes
that it's effective if we split up into two groups of two and tackle the project in that manner. Two
of our teammates are frontend maestros and the other two are well versed in Python, so we plan on
basing our project around those ideas. 

5. **Time Commitment** 

We expect about 2-3 hours of work from each group member. We will address new conflicts by covering
for our teammates. However, after repeated instances of a lack of contribution, we will have to
appraoch things differently. We expect everyone to participate equally because we each have prior 
committments that we have to work around in order to ensure a successful completion of this project.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

If someone has a conflict, they should address it to the team two days prior to any deadline. That
way, we're able to effectively tackle any sort of conflict without impeding the progress of the
project. We don't foresee any major conflicts, maybe different ways of logical appraoch towards an
algorithm. We're all on the same page.
